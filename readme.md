# Keyboard Script Generator #

This is a simple, self-contained web page that you can (and should!) use to
write scripts for Ronin's input-injection USB dongle. Heck, you can host a copy
if you want. Because it's all in one file, you can just download and open it to
get started.

## Issues ##

If you're using Firefox, the "save" button will give you a file with some weird
"Ax4nQ.part" file. This is the right file, and contains the text you've written.

If you're using Internet Explorer without Chrome Frame, this will probably just
not work at all due to IE's weird, restrictive 'support' for Data URIs. I
haven't tried, though.
